## üîß Installation

### Method 1: Mission File Installation (Client-Side)

1. **Download the Script**
   ```
   Download recruit_ai.sqf from this repository
   ```

2. **Add to Mission Root**
   - Extract your mission PBO (e.g., `Exile.Altis.pbo`)
   - Place `recruit_ai.sqf` in the root folder of your mission

3. **Edit init.sqf**
   - Open (or create) `init.sqf` in the mission root
   - Add this line at the bottom:
   ```sqf
   [] execVM "recruit_ai.sqf";
   ```

4. **Repack Mission PBO**
   - Repack your mission folder as a PBO
   - Upload to server's `MPMissions` folder
   - Restart mission/server

### Method 2: Server-Side Installation (Recommended)

1. **Add to Server Addon**
   - Place `recruit_ai.sqf` in your server addon folder
   - Example: `@ExileServer\addons\exile_server\scripts\`

2. **Modify config.cpp**
   - Add reference to the script in your server config
   ```cpp
   class CfgExileCustomCode
   {
       ExileServer_object_player_createBambi = "exile_server\scripts\recruit_ai.sqf";
   };
   ```

3. **Alternative: Direct Execution**
   - Add to your server's `initServer.sqf`:
   ```sqf
   [] execVM "path\to\recruit_ai.sqf";
   ```

### Method 3: Player addAction (Optional - For Manual Spawning)

If you want players to manually recruit AI:

```sqf
player addAction [
    "Recruit Elite Squad",
    {
        [] execVM "recruit_ai.sqf";
    },
    [],
    1.5,
    true,
    true,
    "",
    "true",
    5
];
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit these variables at the top of the script to customize behavior:

```sqf
// Maximum AI squadmates (default: 3)
private _maxSquadmates = 3;

// Detection ranges
RECRUIT_VEHICLE_BOARD_RADIUS = 300;      // Vehicle auto-board distance
RECRUIT_DETECTION_RADIUS = 1500;          // Enemy visual detection
RECRUIT_AUDIO_DETECTION_RADIUS = 2000;    // Sound detection
RECRUIT_CALLOUT_INTERVAL = 8;             // Enemy callout frequency (seconds)
RECRUIT_REARM_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30;        // Ammo check interval (seconds)
RECRUIT_RESPAWN_COOLDOWN = 15;            // Delay after respawn (seconds)
```

### Customizing AI Roles

To modify AI loadouts, edit the `RECRUIT_fnc_rearmUnit` function (starts at line 180).

### Changing Faction Relations

Modify the faction configuration section (lines 54-75) to change who AI fights:

```sqf
// Make AI hostile to EAST
RESISTANCE setFriend [EAST, 0];
EAST setFriend [RESISTANCE, 0];

// Make AI friendly to WEST
RESISTANCE setFriend [WEST, 1];
WEST setFriend [RESISTANCE, 1];
```
